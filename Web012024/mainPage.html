    <h2>About Us</h2>
    
    <p class="paragraphs">We are an organization that is devoted to creating positive change in the lives of
      Pokot girls through access to quality education and mentorship program. Our goal is
      to continue rescuing girls from FGM/C, early marriages and GBV and put them in safe
      environment where they can thrive.</p>

    <h2>What We Do</h2>

    <p class="paragraphs">Our work began in Cheposekek, West Pokot County. An area where girls
      are at risk of early marriages and FGM/C. Harmful practices like FGM/C
      continue to impair the health, well-being, and future of girls and women.
      One of the biggest barriers to Pokot girls’ education is the lack of
      financing for programs that actively support their education journeys and
      opportunities for finishing basic education. Parents have to make tough
      decisions on which child they should send to school. In the Cheposekek
      community, it's often the boy child that’s prioritized. As a result, girls in
      this community lack education opportunities due to gender inequality.
      We tackle FGM/C, early marriages and GBV through education. We
      provide full tuition for 12 highschool girls while also mentoring. This
      program has influenced girls in the community to attend school. For the
      first time we had the biggest 9th grade class enrollment.</p>
